# Jott.ly
Jott.ly is a basic ficticious landing page for an cloud service of the same name. It was developed by following a Bloc.io tutorial (with some custom changes).
The link to the tutorial is [here.](https://www.bloc.io/tutorials/jottly-a-beginner-s-guide-to-html-css-skeleton-and-animate-css#!/chapters/647)
Unlike the tutorial, I used Skeleton 2.0, thus some things required changes to look similar to what was intended originally.
